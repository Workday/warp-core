The `MeasurementCollectionController` (often called `MCC`) class is the central "overlord" responsible for tracking all
registered collectors and arbiters, wrapping collectors around measured tests in the correct order,
and invoking the measured code block.

Note that all collectors must be stopped in the reverse order from which they were started to maximize
measurement accuracy and avoid capturing the overheard from other collectors.

The multiple circles of hell serve as a useful mental model; each circle represents a logical group of collectors
that is started/stopped in parallel.

`MCC` is the lowest-level api we provide, and it is possible to use this class directly:

{{< highlight scala "linenos=" >}}
@Test
def mcc(testInfo: TestInfo): Unit = {
  val mcc = new DefaultMeasurementCollectionController(testId = testInfo)
  mcc.registerCollector(new SomeMeasurementCollector)
  // start all measurement collectors prior to running the experiment
  mcc.beginMeasurementCollection()

  // run your experiment code
  someExperiment()

  // stop all measurement collectors, persist results, other cleanup
  mcc.endMeasurementCollection()
}

The DSL encapsulates the above sequence of operations in a more convenient API and provides some higher-level 
configuration options.
