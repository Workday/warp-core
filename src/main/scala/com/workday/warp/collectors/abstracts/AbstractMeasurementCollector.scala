/**
  * Used to start and stop measurement collection.
  *
  * Implementations of a measurement or measurement collection should extend this class, and probably mix in
  * [[com.workday.warp.persistence.CorePersistenceAware]]. Note that the collection of a measurement may encompass a number of
  * different types of operations. It may include such activities as collecting from JMX, scraping server logs, or as
  * simple as starting and stopping a clock.
  *
  * Created by tomas.mccandless on 8/13/15.
  * Based on a java interface created by michael.ottati on 8/20/13.
  *
  * @constructor create a new measurement collector with a test id.
  * @param _testId id of the test being measured. mutable, but the setter is only accessible within the collectors
  *                package.
